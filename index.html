    <h2> Shasport</h2>

        <p>Shasport is a large, expansive city where many different races live. It is mainly a business melting pot where companies of any kind can operate without fear of the police (for the most part). Majority of the living space in this city is apartments and upscale hotels. Many people opt to vacation within the city itself as it is so expansive and with all the creature comforts. With so many different races and traditions being in one place, it is still a place of conflict even decades after converging into Shasport to begin with. Sabotage and assassinations are not uncommon but stay out of the public eye, happening at high end events and meetings where live changing deals happen. Companies go after each other, CEO’s clash in battles of wits, and the uncertainty of the future looms over everyone’s head.</p>

    <h2> Annetenol</h2>

     <div><a href="Annetenol.html"> <img src="b78f0c09f2823eb027f9d4a4c7aebf9e.jpg" width="600"/> </a></div>
     <p>Annetenol is the “downtown” of Shasport where many people go to retire. It is like a mix of downtown city and suburban quiet, not a lot of traffic and more grass than concrete. There are shady deals that happen but overall everyone behaves and lives peacefully. White picket fences and trimmed hedges line the roads and family owned stores sustain the community. </p>

    <h2> Zevine</h2>
   
     <div> <a href="Zevine.html"> <img src="tumblr_8607e64c0d87c374aea70370f2e44bda_bd6862d9_1280.jpg" width="600"/> </a></div>
     <p>Zevine is the underground section of Shasport. Many refer to Zevine as the “Underworld” but make no mistake, the underground is clean and legit businesses operate without problems. Many sections have faux-sun lamps to replace the sun's rays in shade covered sections. Zevine is a technology hub where many biotech companies operate, offering a plethora of enhancements and upgrades for any situation. It is not heavily regulated as it would be in the main city above ground. While people can walk around without much fear and life is not much different than above ground for many, there are some who’s lives change everyday within its grounds.    </p>
