        <h3>Radar</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are three main companies that operate in Shasport that tend to get the most violent when things don't get their way. The main character, codename Radar, works for Destiny Arts, primarily a shipping company that also can be commissioned to manufacture select products. Radar is not a direct worker at the company but was hired through an information hub that took his submission and matched him to Destiny Arts. He works mainly as a bodyguard but can also operate as an assassin, targeting competitors that actively try to sabotage Destiny Arts and are not careful about it.</p>

        <h3>Scott</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Radar has many contacts he utilizes while on the job, one being his adoptive father, Scott. Scott was a bartender and waiter for a longtime before taking an early retirement. During his time working however he was able to collect a few acquaintances and friends that supply him with information about the leading companies in exchange for things he learned about specific people while bartending. Scott and Radar met while Rads was going through a rough patch in life and Scott took him under his wing.

        <h3>Ramen</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Radar's main partner does not work for Destiny Arts but is commissioned more often than not by the company. Ramen is a synthetic AI made of a radioactive substance that possessed a lab computer and achieved sentience. Ramen was named after the scientist that discovered him but soon after he wanted to escape the lab and soon made his way from Zevine to Shasport. After arriving in the big city and trying to find a way to survive, he was infected by a sentient virus that slowly ate away at his software. To prevent returning to oblivion, he made a deal with the virus to hunt other robots so the virus could feed and keep his programming safe. After that fiasco, he was hired by the same information hub that Radar was and was assigned to Destiny Arts periodically.
